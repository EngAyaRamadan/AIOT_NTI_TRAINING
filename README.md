# AIOT_NTI_TRAINING



**📚AIoT Track – Weekly Summary**

This repository reflects my progress during the first weeks of the AIoT Track at NTI, where the focus gradually shifted from programming fundamentals to embedded systems design and real-time applications.

**Week 1 – C Programming Foundations**

 1.Refreshing C programming fundamentals with an embedded mindset

 2.Modular programming using multiple .c and .h files

 3.Using Makefile and CMake for project build automation

 4.Applying concepts through a console-based ATM Simulator project

 5.Practicing file handling and system-level thinking



---

**Week 2 – Embedded Modules & Communication**

Building structured modules using available libraries for:

   GPIO,ADC,UART,Wi-Fi,Sensors,LED & Button,PWM,MQTT


Understanding how to wrap libraries into clean, reusable modules

Developing a small IoT project:

 1.Reading a potentiometer via ADC

 2.Publishing data using MQTT to HiveMQ Cloud

 3.Subscribing to control an LED remotely

**Week 3 – RTOS & System Design**

Introduction to RTOS concepts:

 1.OS, Kernel, Scheduler

 2.Tasks and multitasking challenges

 3.Semaphores, Mutexes, Event Groups

 4.Queues, Mailboxes, Task Notifications


 5.Applying FreeRTOS on simple modules (LED & Button)

 6.Exploring static vs dynamic software design approaches

 7.Building a small RTOS-based project to apply learned concepts
