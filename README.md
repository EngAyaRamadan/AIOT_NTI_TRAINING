# AIOT_NTI_TRAINING



📚 AIoT Track – Weekly Summary

This repository reflects my progress during the first weeks of the AIoT Track at NTI, where the focus gradually shifted from programming fundamentals to embedded systems design and real-time applications.

**Week 1 – C Programming Foundations**

Refreshing C programming fundamentals with an embedded mindset

Modular programming using multiple .c and .h files

Using Makefile and CMake for project build automation

Applying concepts through a console-based ATM Simulator project

Practicing file handling and system-level thinking



---

**Week 2 – Embedded Modules & Communication**

Building structured modules using available libraries for:

GPIO

ADC

UART

Wi-Fi

Sensors

LED & Button

PWM

MQTT


Understanding how to wrap libraries into clean, reusable modules

Developing a small IoT project:

Reading a potentiometer via ADC

Publishing data using MQTT to HiveMQ Cloud

Subscribing to control an LED remotely
